This program solves puzzles from the "Move: A Brain Shifting Game" on the Google Play Store.

Just follow these steps:

1) Compile all java files.
2) Run MoveSolver.
3) Type a representation of the board, one row at a time. Use '-' for blank spots, 'x' for walls,
   and 'o' for dots.
4) Enter the coordinates of the goals. The top left of the board is 0, 0. The first coordinate is
   for the row, and the second is the column.
